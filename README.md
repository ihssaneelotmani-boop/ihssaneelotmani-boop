Hi, I'm Ihssane

Industrial Engineering student focused on data-driven decision making, process optimization, and operational performance improvement. I am particularly interested in transforming raw data into actionable insights that improve efficiency, reduce waste, and support strategic decisions.

Through academic projects and technical training, I have applied analytical tools to explore predictive maintenance concepts, industrial performance indicators, and process optimization techniques. My involvement in engineering and technology clubs has strengthened my practical understanding of Lean principles, structured problem-solving, and continuous improvement methodologies.

I am currently developing projects that combine engineering logic with data analysis, aiming to bridge the gap between industrial systems and analytical tools.

Core Interests:

Data Analysis & Business Intelligence
